    <h1>Hello, my name is Guilherme.</h1>
    <p>My favourite color is green, but not any green, the light-lime-green specifically.</p>
    <p>My favourite food is pasta (all kinds of pasta, but if you ask me to choose one, I would say bolognese lasagna).</p>
    <p>My favourite hobby is to watch movies at theaters.</p>
